## Gap Analysis

### ðŸ”´ Critical Missing Features

#### 1. Command-Line Tools (High Impact)
- **Composer**: Package management for PHP
- **Laravel Installer**: Quick Laravel project creation
- **Node/npm/nvm**: JavaScript toolchain
- **Expose**: Tunnel service for sharing local sites

**Impact**: Developers must install these tools separately or use containers

#### 2. Developer Tools (Medium Impact)
- **Profiler**: No Blackfire or XHProf integration
- **Dumps Interceptor**: No dd() capture UI
- **Log Viewer**: No integrated log UI (uses docker logs)
- **Database GUI**: No TablePlus integration

**Impact**: Reduced debugging convenience, but alternatives exist

#### 3. Site Management (Low Impact)
- **Per-site PHP versions**: All services share PHP version
- **GUI Interface**: CLI-only (no desktop app)
- **Forge Integration**: No deployment features

**Impact**: Minor inconvenience for multi-project workflows

## Fleet's Unique Advantages

### 1. **Platform Independence**
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Herd limited to macOS and Windows only
- Critical for Linux developers

### 2. **Docker-Based Architecture**
- Complete environment isolation
- Portable across machines
- Consistent behavior across platforms
- Easy cleanup and reset

### 3. **Open Source**
- Community-driven development
- No Pro/Free tier split
- All features available to everyone
- Transparent codebase

### 4. **Configuration as Code**
- TOML/YAML/JSON configuration files
- Version control friendly
- Team sharing via git
- Reproducible environments

### 5. **Resource Efficiency**
- Shared container pattern
- Services using same versions share containers
- Lower memory footprint
- Optimized for multi-project setups

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days each)

#### Composer/Node Support
```toml
[[services]]
name = "tools"
runtime = "node:20"
composer = true  # Auto-mount and configure
```

#### Log Viewer Integration
- Web-based log viewer using existing docker logs
- Real-time streaming capabilities
- Search and filter functionality

#### Database GUI Configuration
- Auto-generate TablePlus bookmarks
- Export connection strings
- DBeaver workspace files

### Phase 2: Enhanced Developer Experience (3-5 days)

#### Site Isolation
```toml
[[services]]
name = "legacy-app"
runtime = "php:7.4"  # Pinned version
php_isolation = true  # Don't share PHP container
```

#### Profiler Integration
```toml
[[services]]
name = "api"
profiler = "blackfire"  # or "xhprof"
profiler_token = "..."
```

#### Tunnel Service
```toml
[[services]]
name = "web"
tunnel = "ngrok"  # or "cloudflare"
tunnel_subdomain = "my-app"
```

### Phase 3: Nice-to-Have Features

- Web UI for service management
- Automatic framework updates
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Multi-region simulation

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Herd Claims | Fleet Performance |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Test Speed** | 35% faster | Docker overhead (~5-10% slower) |
| **Web Requests** | 100% faster | Native Docker performance |
| **Memory Usage** | Not specified | Efficient with container sharing |
| **Startup Time** | Instant | 2-5 seconds (container startup) |

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose Fleet When:
- Developing on Linux
- Need complete environment isolation
- Working in teams (config sharing)
- Prefer open-source tools
- Need custom Docker configurations
- Want version-controlled environments

### Choose Herd When:
- Using macOS/Windows exclusively
- Need GUI interface
- Want integrated profiler/dumps
- Prefer native performance
- Need Forge deployment integration
- Willing to pay for Pro features

## Migration Guide

### From Herd to Fleet

1. **Export database data**
   ```bash
   mysqldump -u root -p database > backup.sql
   ```

2. **Create Fleet configuration**
   ```toml
   name = "my-app"
   
   [[services]]
   name = "web"
   runtime = "php:8.3"
   framework = "laravel"
   domain = "my-app.test"
   database = "mysql:8.0"
   cache = "redis:7.2"
   reverb = true
   ssl = true
   ```

3. **Initialize Fleet**
   ```bash
   fleet init
   fleet up -d
   ```

4. **Import database**
   ```bash
   docker exec -i mysql-80 mysql -u root -p database < backup.sql
   ```

## Conclusion

Fleet provides a compelling, open-source alternative to Laravel Herd with comprehensive Docker-based infrastructure. While missing some convenience features like built-in Composer and GUI tools, Fleet excels in:

- **Completeness**: All core services needed for Laravel development
- **Portability**: Works everywhere Docker runs
- **Transparency**: Open-source with active development
- **Efficiency**: Smart container sharing reduces resource usage
- **Flexibility**: Configuration as code enables team workflows

For Laravel developers, especially those on Linux or preferring open-source tools, Fleet offers a production-ready development environment that rivals commercial alternatives.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Add Composer/Node container support (highest developer impact)
2. **Short-term**: Implement log viewer and database GUI configs
3. **Medium-term**: Add profiler integration and tunnel services
4. **Long-term**: Consider optional web UI for those who prefer it

Fleet's architecture is well-positioned to close the remaining gaps while maintaining its core advantages of simplicity, portability, and openness.
